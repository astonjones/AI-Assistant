Future Features:
- Database integration
    - Application will lookup each number in the database, if there is history then prompt accordingly. Else create new db entry.

- Make Initial prompt user editable via an API or implement a user friendly design to edit this. We want to make it easy to deploy these agents with other use case.

- Authentication
    - I need to find a way to authenticate all the API requests. I can't have just anyone hitting my server without the proper permissions. FIgure out a simple and cheap design.

- Implement easy notification to admin user
    - We need to summarize calls in post, and let the primary admin user know these summarizations. Probably via text or telegram.

- Easy deployment
    - Figure where to have this application hosted.

1.) Implement Postgresql db - production ready
2.) Figure out Authentication design.
3.) Containerize application.
4.) Create prompt for Property Management/Personal Use
4.) Deploy via AWS?
5.) Forward Number to new bot via Twilio Config
6.) Update divinationhomes website

Step 4.) Repeat process - deploy bot for AI Automation business.
